# Language Session Persistence Setup

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation of persistent language settings in session storage for the Resteel website. Language preferences are now stored in the user's session and persist across all pages and browser sessions.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Key Features:
- **Session Persistence**: Language choice is stored in Laravel session
- **Instant Language Switching**: No page reload required
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback on API failures
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript linter errors
- **Proper Validation**: Server-side locale validation
- **CSRF Protection**: Secure POST requests for language changes

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### 1. Frontend Components

#### `resources/js/components/layout/Header.tsx`
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript linter error by replacing `any` with proper `PageProps` interface
- ✅ Updated language change API to use POST method with proper payload
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with console logging
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces

### 2. Backend Controllers

#### `app/Http/Controllers/LocaleController.php` (NEW)
**Purpose:** Handles language switching with proper session management and validation

### 3. Middleware Updates

#### `app/Http/Middleware/SetLocale.php`
**Enhanced Features:**
- ✅ Improved locale validation
- ✅ Session correction for invalid locales
- ✅ Better error handling

#### `bootstrap/app.php`
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added `SetLocale` middleware to web middleware stack
- ✅ Proper middleware ordering (SetLocale runs first)

### 4. Route Configuration

#### `routes/web.php`
**New Routes Added:**
- POST `/locale/change` - Primary language switching route
- GET `/locale/current` - API route to get current locale info
- GET `/locale/{locale}` - Backward compatibility route

## 🔧 How Language Persistence Works

1. **User Changes Language** → Frontend sends POST request to `/locale/change`
2. **Session Storage** → Backend stores locale in Laravel session
3. **Page Loads** → Middleware reads locale from session and sets app locale
4. **Frontend Receives** → Inertia shares current locale with React components

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ CSRF Protection on POST requests
- ✅ Server-side input validation
- ✅ Session security with HTTP-only cookies
- ✅ Secure cookies in production (HTTPS)

## 📱 Session Configuration

Current settings use database-driven sessions with 2-hour lifetime, configurable via environment variables.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Language changes instantly without page reload
- [x] Language persists across page navigation
- [x] Language persists across browser sessions
- [x] Error handling works (network failures)
- [x] TypeScript linter errors resolved
- [x] CSRF protection enabled
- [x] Input validation working
- [x] Session middleware registered
- [x] API endpoints functional
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The language persistence system is now fully implemented and ready for production use. Users' language preferences will be maintained throughout their session and across browser refreshes.
